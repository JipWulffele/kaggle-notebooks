# Kaggle-Notebooks

Welcome to my Kaggle Notebooks repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from various Kaggle competitions, where I explore data, build models, and analyze results.Each competition folder also includes a `markdown` subfolder containing the code and output exported as markdown for easy viewing and sharing.

## ðŸ“Œ Current Competitions

### [CIBMTR - Equity in post-HCT Survival Predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cibmtr-equity)
- **Goal:** Develop predictive models for post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survival while addressing equity concerns.
- **Notebook:** [`transplanting_data_into_insights.ipynb`](./cibmtr_equity/transplanting-data-into-insights.ipynb)
- **Approach:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models.

### [Playground Series - Predicting Podcast Listening Time](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e4/overview)
- **Goal:** Predict listening times of podcast episodes.
- **Notebook:** [`eda-ensemble-pytorch-xgboost-help-wanted.ipynb`](./predict_podcast_listening_time/eda-ensemble-pytorch-xgboost-help-wanted.ipynb)
- **Approach:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models (XGBoost & PyTorch).

### [Playground Series - Predict Calorie Expenditure](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e5/overview)
- **Goal:** Predict how many calories where burned during a workout.
- **Notebook:** [`burining-calories-a-model-comparison-ridge-ensem.ipynb`](./predict_calorie_expenditure/burning-calories-a-model-comparison-ridge-ensem.ipynb)
- **Approach:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models (various base models and ridge ensemble).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JipWulffele/Kaggle-Notebooks.git
   cd kaggle-notebooks
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   If required, install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the notebook:**
   Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. **Using Helper Notebooks:**
   - The main notebooks might rely on helper notebooks for reusable functions.
   - `pip_install_liberies.ipynb` installs necessary packages when Kaggleâ€™s internet is disabled.
   - Ensure helper notebooks are present in `notebooks/xxx/` before running the main notebook.

## ðŸ“Œ Future Plans
- Add more notebooks from other Kaggle competitions.
- Improve documentation and model explanations.
- Experiment with different machine learning techniques.
