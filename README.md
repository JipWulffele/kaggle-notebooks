# Kaggle-Notebooks

Welcome to my Kaggle Notebooks repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from various Kaggle competitions, where I explore data, build models, and analyze results.Each competition folder also includes a `markdown` subfolder containing the code and output exported as markdown for easy viewing and sharing.

## ðŸ“Œ Current Competitions

### [CMI - Detect Behavior with Sensor Data](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cmi-detect-behavior-with-sensor-data/overview)
- **Goal:** Classify body-focused repetitive behaviors (BFRBs) vs. non-BFRB gestures using multimodal wrist sensor data.
- **Approach:** Time series modeling with the `sktime` library, ensemble of classifiers, handedness normalization, and sensor-specific preprocessing.

### [CIBMTR - Equity in post-HCT Survival Predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cibmtr-equity)
- **Goal:** Develop predictive models for post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survival while addressing equity concerns.
- **Notebook:** [`transplanting_data_into_insights.ipynb`](./cibmtr_equity/transplanting-data-into-insights.ipynb)
- **Approach:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models.

### [Playground Series - Predicting Podcast Listening Time](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e4/overview)
- **Goal:** Predict listening times of podcast episodes.
- **Notebook:** [`eda-ensemble-pytorch-xgboost-help-wanted.ipynb`](./predict_podcast_listening_time/eda-ensemble-pytorch-xgboost-help-wanted.ipynb)
- **Approach:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models (XGBoost & PyTorch).

### [Playground Series - Predict Calorie Expenditure](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e5/overview)
- **Goal:** Predict how many calories where burned during a workout.
- **Notebook:** [`burining-calories-a-model-comparison-ridge-ensem.ipynb`](./predict_calorie_expenditure/burning-calories-a-model-comparison-ridge-ensem.ipynb)
- **Approach:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models (various base models and ridge ensemble).

## ðŸ“Œ Future Plans
- Add more notebooks from other Kaggle competitions.
- Improve documentation and model explanations.
- Experiment with different machine learning techniques.
